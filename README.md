# HR_Analytics_Dashboard
Based on the HR Analytics Dashboard provided in the PDF, I can offer several professional insights:
Attrition Overview:
The company has 1,470 employees, with 237 cases of attrition, which is a significant number.
This suggests an attrition rate of about 16%, which is relatively high and may be a cause for concern.

Demographics:
The average age of employees is 37 years.
The average salary is $6,500 per month (assuming 'K' stands for thousands).
The average tenure is 7.01 years.

Attrition by Education:
Medical field employees account for the highest attrition at 38%.
Life Sciences (27%), Marketing (15%), and Technical Degree (14%) follow.
This suggests that employees with medical backgrounds are more likely to leave, possibly due to high demand in the healthcare sector.

Attrition by Age:
The 26-35 age group has the highest attrition (116 employees).
This is followed by the 18-25 and 36-45 age groups (44 and 43 respectively).
Younger employees seem more likely to leave, which could indicate a need for better retention strategies for early-career professionals.

Attrition by Job Role:
Laboratory Technicians have the highest attrition (62), followed by Sales Executives (57) and Research Scientists (47).
This might indicate issues specific to these roles, such as work conditions, career growth, or competitive job markets.

Attrition by Salary:
The majority of attrition (163 cases) occurs in the "Up to 5k" salary range.
This suggests that lower-paid employees are more likely to leave, possibly for better compensation elsewhere.

Attrition by Years at Company:
The highest attrition seems to occur among employees with 0-2 years at the company.
This indicates a potential issue with onboarding, early job satisfaction, or misalignment of expectations.

Gender Distribution in Attrition:
More males (140) than females (79) are leaving the company.
This could reflect the overall gender distribution in the company or point to gender-specific issues.
